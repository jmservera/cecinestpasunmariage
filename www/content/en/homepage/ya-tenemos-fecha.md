**Dress Code**: we have called it "Casual Cocktail" <br/>
So, an informal party, or cocktail party will be OK. <br/>
You don't need a tie, suits, or stilettos. <br />

Take it easy. Keep in mind that the party will be in a place with a garden and lawn. <br>
The most important thing for us is that you are comfortable! <br />
(You can leave your heels and tie at home!)

**Vegetarian Menu**. <br />
As you probably know, Isa is a vegetarian and her concept of celebration does not include killing any animals to celebrate anything. <br />
Therefore, the food that will be served at the celebration will be delicious, but it will contain neither meat nor fish. <br />

**Entertainment for children** <br />
So that both adults and children can enjoy the party, we will have a group specialized in children's entertainment. With a lot of games, costumes and a Bounce Castle. We all going to enjoy a lot, young and adults! :)
