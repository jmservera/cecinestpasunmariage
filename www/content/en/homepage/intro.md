Dear friend or family, we are pleased to announce that we are hosting a party to celebrate a **special moment** in our lives. 

A few years ago we decided that we wanted to be **all our lives together** and we want to have a **big party** to celebrate it. We are so excited to share this day with all the **people** who are **important in our lives**. If you got here through a QR, you are one of them ;)

The date of the party is **May 3, 2025** and we will celebrate it in Isa's **Granada** birth, in a fantastic place called "[Jardines La Clave](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jardines+La+Clave/@37.0795974,-3.6098415,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0xd71fa9a365054fd:0x68f8996ef6a2d5da!8m2!3d37.0795974!4d-3.6072666!16s%2Fg%2F11dxkbzhgp?entry=ttu)" ([see below for more information](#the-party)).

If you are from abroad and want to come and spend the weekend, or visit Granada for a few more days, we have prepared a section on what things you can't miss in the city: [More about Granada](Granada).

We hope you can come and celebrate this special moment with us.

That is, in case you're wondering what "!wedding" means. In programming, the symbol "!" is used as the logical negation operator. You can read it as "no wedding."
