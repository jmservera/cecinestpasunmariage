title: "More about Granada"

On May 3rd, it's the "Day of the Cross" and the whole Granada will dress up for the celebration.
If you are from outside, our recommendation is to take advantage of the weekend to experience this unique festival.

If you take the trip to see other things, it's important to note that you need to get the ticket to visit the Alhambra at least one week in advance.
