title: "More about Granada"

Granada (although of course, I may be biased) is a beautiful city. It dazzles with its rich history, architecture, and natural beauty.

Every corner whispers tales of a glorious past, uniquely blending Moorish and Christian influences.

If it's your first time visiting Granada, or if you haven’t been before, I 100% recommend visiting the majestic **Alhambra**, with its palaces and gardens, standing as a symbol of the cultural fusion that permeates the city.  
The Alhambra is one of the most famous monuments in Spain. Construction began in 1238, but it was really during the 14th century that the royal palaces were built, giving it its distinctive character.

You can explore beautifully decorated palaces, fortresses, and gardens.  
**Important!** [Book your tickets in advance](https://www.alhambra-patronato.es/) because only 6,600 people are allowed to enter each day, and tickets usually sell out several weeks beforehand.

The aroma of jasmine and Moorish spices fills the air as you stroll through the narrow cobblestone streets of the [**Albaicín**](https://www.granadadirect.com/rincones/albayzin-granada/), an old Moorish neighborhood with traditional white buildings.

From the **[San Nicolás Viewpoint](https://turismo.granada.org/es/monumento/mirador/mirador-san-nicolas)**, watching the Alhambra at sunset is a spectacle that captures the essence of Granada: natural beauty and architectural wonders.

They even say that Bill Clinton, during a visit to Granada in 1997 while he was president, remarked that [this sunset was one of the most beautiful in the world](https://www.espanaguide.com/granada/mirador-de-san-nicolas/). I can’t confirm it because I wasn’t there. But I believe it ;)

But Granada isn’t just about history; it’s a sensory experience. Granada is **[famous for its tapas culture](https://www.eldiario.es/viajes/tapas-granada-bares-imprescindibles_1_10425830.html)**.  
Every time you order a drink at a bar, you usually get a tapa. And a tapa is not just some nuts, olives, or salty crackers. They are real dishes: meatballs, sandwiches, meat in sauce, Spanish omelet. In some places, you even get a list of tapas to choose from.

The best tapas areas are Elvira Street, the Cathedral area, and Plaza Nueva (Bar La Riviera, La Nueva Bodega, Bodega Castañeda, or Saint Germain). Also, Navas Street near City Hall (Los Diamantes, Taberna Las Copas, Taberna la Garrocha, Blanca Paloma, or Gamboa) or in the Albaicín itself, where you can enjoy tapas with views of the Alhambra.  
Try some local dishes while exploring the city.

My advice is not to order separate tapas or portions. Just keep drinking, and eat with the tapas (free). That’s the experience.

If you want to have breakfast like a local from Granada, try a traditional Andalusian breakfast called _mollete_.

You can also visit the **[Cathedral of Granada](https://catedraldegranada.com/)** and the **[Royal Chapel](https://capillarealgranada.com/)**, admire the Gothic architecture and royal tombs, **explore the [Realejo](https://www.guiarepsol.com/es/viajar/vamos-de-excursion/el-realejo-el-barrio-judio-de-la-granada-musulmana/)**, a picturesque Jewish neighborhood with plenty of bars and restaurants, or relax at the **[Carmen de los Mártires](https://turismo.granada.org/es/areas-tematicas/bodas-palacios/carmen-martires)**: These gardens are a peaceful oasis in the middle of the city.

To complete the experience, you can listen to the sounds of **flamenco on the streets of Sacromonte**, see the [caves with flamenco shows](https://flamencosacromonte.org/), visit the **[Monastery of San Jerónimo](https://www.andalucia.org/es/granada-visitas-monasterio-de-san-jeronimo)**, enjoy the aroma of freshly made churros, and immerse yourself in Granada’s vibrant nightlife.

And... by the way! As if that weren’t enough, May 3rd is the "[Day of the Cross](https://www.ruralidays.com/viajar/cultura/dia-de-la-cruz-en-granada/)" and all of Granada will be celebrating.

If you’re from abroad, our recommendation is to take advantage of the weekend to experience this unique festival.
