Title: Registration Closed (Like Our Patience When Setting Up This Website!)
---

Dearest friends and family, we've hit the "maximum occupancy" sign at the La Clave gardens restaurant for our cocktail shindig. Blame it on our impeccable taste (and the fire marshal). If you're holding an invitation hostage, now's the time to use it, or forever hold your peace (or, you know, just let us know, and we'll pull some strings... maybe).

Why the fuss? Well, picture this: a sudden downpour, and some of you are left out in the cold, clutching your tiny umbrellas. Not on our watch! We're aiming for cozy, not chaotic. Every detail has been meticulously planned (mostly by someone who shall remain nameless), and we want everyone under one roof, rain or shine.

Now, if you're a coding ninja who's managed to bypass our highly sophisticated (read: embarrassingly simple) registration system, hats off to you! You've earned a spot. We can't wait to celebrate with you... and maybe ask for your help fixing the Wi-Fi. ðŸŽ‰
