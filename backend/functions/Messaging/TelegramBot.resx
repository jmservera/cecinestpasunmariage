# Intro

In the web site you can find all the information about the party: [https://cecinestpasunmariage.org/en](https://cecinestpasunmariage.org/en)

Dear friend or family member, we are pleased to announce that we are organizing a party to celebrate a special moment in our lives. A few years ago we decided that we wanted to be together for life and we want to have a big party to celebrate it.
We are very excited to share this day with all the people who are important in our lives. If you have arrived here through a QR, you are one of them.
The date of the party is May 3, 2025, and we will celebrate it in Isa's hometown of Granada, at a fantastic place called [Jardines La Clave](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jardines+La+Clave/@37.0795974,-3.6098415,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0xd71fa9a365054fd:0x68f8996ef6a2d5da!8m2!3d37.0795974!4d-3.6072666!16s%2Fg%2F11dxkbzhgp?entry=ttu).
If you are from out of town and want to spend the weekend, or visit Granada for a few more days, we have prepared a section on what you cannot miss in the city: [More about Granada](https://lanobodadeisayjuanma.com/en/granada/).
We hope you can come to celebrate this special moment with us.
By the way, in case you are wondering what ‚Äú!boda‚Äù means. In programming, the symbol ‚Äú!‚Äù is used as the logical negation operator. You can read it as ‚Äúno wedding‚Äù.

# Gifts

Many of you have asked us if we want any gifts. Actually, what we would like most is for you to come and celebrate with us, and coming to Granada from far away, with the cost of travel and accommodation, is already a sufficient gift.
Come and spend a great day with us, that's what we would like the most.

# Hotel

Our recommendation: Hotel Abades Nevada Palace 4*
We and our family (from outside) will stay here the night before and the night after.
The bus will leave from here at 12.30 am
https://www.abadeshoteles.com/es/hotel-abades-nevada-palace-en-granada/
A 15-minute taxi ride from the venue. And 10 minutes by taxi from the center of Granada.
Approx. 100‚Ç¨ per night.

# The party

**Date**: May 3rd, 2025 
**Time**: 1:00 p.m.
**Site**: [Jardines La Clave](https://maps.app.goo.gl/234ycG7ryKviRH7V6)

**Dress Code**: we have called it "Casual Cocktail" 
So, an informal party, or cocktail party will be OK. 
You don't need a tie, suits, or stilettos. 

Take it easy. Keep in mind that the party will be in a place with a garden and lawn. 
The most important thing for us is that you are comfortable! 
(You can leave your heels and tie at home!)

**Vegetarian Menu**. 
As you probably know, Isa is a vegetarian and her concept of celebration does not include killing any animals to celebrate anything. 
Therefore, the food that will be served at the celebration will be delicious, but it will contain neither meat nor fish. 
If you want to know more about the menu: https://cecinestpasunmariage.org/en/menu

**Entertainment for children** 
So that both adults and children can enjoy the party, we will have a group specialized in children's entertainment. With a lot of games, costumes and a Bounce Castle. We all going to enjoy a lot, young and adults!
